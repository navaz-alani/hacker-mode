# How to Contribute

Of course, there is a lot of work to be done and the tool-set contained in this
image accrues as I learn about ethical hacking in my own time.

If you find this project useful and would like to contribute to developing
a richer side-environment for hacking, please do so by opening up a
pull-request.

To add a tool into the environment, add its name to the `progs` array in the
`install.sh` script (if it is available on the homebrew repo).
Other installations may also be performed in this script.

Thanks,

Navaz.
